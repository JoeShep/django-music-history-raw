# Stuff to test
# context: what we send to the template
# content: the rendered html
# response_codes

# Name your tests like this! test_foo so Django can find and run 'em

# * The test client is a Python class that acts as a dummy Web browser, allowing you to test your views and interact with your Django - powered application programmatically. Some of the things you can do with the test client are:
#     * Simulate GET and POST requests on a URL and observe the response – everything from low - level HTTP(result headers and status codes) to page content.
#     * See the chain of redirects(if any) and check the URL and status code at each step.
#     * Test that a given request is rendered by a given Django template, with a template context that contains certain values.

# *  Good rules-of-thumb include having:
#     * a separate TestClass for each model or view
#     * a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test
#     * test method names that describe their function
